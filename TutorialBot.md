# TutorialBot - The Wall Detecting Car

A car that never crashes into a wall. Uses an ultrasonic distance sensor to drive forward until it senses a wall and stops right before it. Uses an LED to indicate that it detects a wall.

**What you will learn**:
 - L298N Motor Controller setup for basic movement
 - (Optional) PWM signals for speed adjustments

## Motor Setup
Follow the club instructions on building the actual robot. Here's a diagram for how the L298N motor controller should be hooked up to the Arduino:
